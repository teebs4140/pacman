## FEATURE:

Interactive web-based Pacman replica game with smooth animations, responsive controls, and GitHub Pages deployment. The game features:

- **Animated Pacman character** with mouth opening/closing synchronized to movement direction
- **Arrow key controls** for fluid movement (up, down, left, right)
- **Creative visual design** using modern Unicode Pacman characters (ðœ±« ðœ±¬ ðœ±­ ðœ±®) and emoji combinations
- **Game mechanics**: pellet collection, ghost AI, collision detection, scoring system
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: runs in any modern browser, deployable to GitHub Pages
- **Performance optimized**: 60fps game loop using requestAnimationFrame

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

### Technical Gotchas & Requirements
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure Canvas and modern JavaScript features work across browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch controls as fallback for mobile devices (future enhancement)
- **Asset Loading**: Implement proper asset preloading to prevent visual glitches
- **Performance Monitoring**: Profile collision detection to maintain 60fps on lower-end devices

### Game Design Considerations
- **Collision Precision**: Grid-based movement vs. pixel-perfect collision (choose grid for authenticity)
- **Animation Timing**: Synchronize mouth animation speed with movement speed for visual consistency
- **Sound Integration**: Prepare architecture for future sound effects (Web Audio API)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core gameplay, add polish features incrementally

### Deployment & Hosting
- **GitHub Pages Limitations**: Static hosting only - no server-side logic needed
- **Domain Configuration**: Option to use custom domain for professional presentation
- **Build Process**: Simple static files, no complex build pipeline required
- **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning for game updates

### Code Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate classes for Pacman, Ghosts, Map, GameEngine
- **State Management**: Clean separation between game state and rendering
- **Code Splitting**: Organize by feature (movement, collision, rendering, input)
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for core game logic, integration tests for user interactions

### Common AI Assistant Oversights
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: Remember to prevent default behaviors and handle key repeat
- **Animation Frame Management**: Don't forget to cleanup intervals and event listeners
- **Canvas Context State**: Always save/restore canvas state when changing drawing properties
- **Unicode Character Support**: Test new 2024 Pacman characters across different browsers/fonts
- **Mobile Viewport**: Configure proper viewport meta tag for consistent mobile experience
